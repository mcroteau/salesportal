<h2>You are now updating your Campaign</h2>
  
<p>In this screen you will be able to add new Sales Actions and order
them by the sequence in which they should be completed.</p>
  
<p>To successfully add/order Sales Actions to you campaign
follow these steps:</p>

<ol class="moreInfo">
	<li>Make sure you have created all Sales Actions for this Campaign</li>
	<li>Select the Sales Action 1 by 1 from the "Select Action to Add:" drop down box</li>
	<li>Click the + sign to the right of the drop down box to add it to the Campaign</li>
	<li>Click Arrows Up or Down to change the sequence in which the Sales Actions should be Completed</li>
	<li>To Save changes, Click Update</li>

</ol>

<p>* If you have done this, then all changes will be saved.  If you did not click Update, 
all the work you did adding/ordering Sales Actions will be lost.</p>

<p>* If you have previously created a Campaign, then assigned the Campaign to a Prospect, you will not be able
to update the Campaign until you have deleted it from the corresponding Prospects. </p>
