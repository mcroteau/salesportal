<h1>Sales Portal 1.2.7 (Oct 2008)</h1>

<p>Sales Portal 1.2.7 has numerous bug fixes and upgrades</p>

<p>Here is a list of bug fixes:</p>

<ul>

<li><span>bug 966 : add creation date to propect sales action</span>
	<p>You will see this in the db.  We have moved this in to keep track of
	salesmen activity.</p></li>

<li><span>Bug 932 : ability to view closed sales actions</span>
	<p>When you close a sales action, you will be able to review on the
	prospect screen.</p></li>

<li><span>Bug  880 : should not delete sales action if belongs to prospect</span>
	<p>We had an issue where admin users were able to delete sales actions, which 
	on the prospect screen would return a blank sales action.  Instead of deleting all
	prospect sales actions when deleting a sales action, we put a check and are forcing	
	the admin user to remove the sales actions from the prospect before deleting.</p></li>

<li><span>bug 758 : print prospect lists uses old headings</span>
	<p>This required a new ireport change.  Now uses the same headings as the search
	results screen.</p></li>

<li><span>bug 1041 : size of characters left box too small</span>
	<p>There was a small issue with the characters left box.  On the note screen it wasnt large 
	enough to see all numbers.  Example:  would see 200 instead of 2000.</p></li>

<li><span>bug 946 : make color on sales actions optional</span>
	<p>After review, we felt it not necessary to require a color when creating a sales action.
	Although having a color there as an option is still very useful.  So, disabled the requirement 
	check.  Can create sales actions without selecting a color.</p></li>

<li><span>bug 935 : search screen by email</span>
	<p>Added the email box on search screen.  You can now search by a primary email address.</p></li>

<li><span>bug 947 : losing yes/no on mandatory date when updating</span>
	<p>mandatory date was being saved, just not being displayed right on the sales action
	maintenance screens.  This is now fixed.</p></li>

<li><span>bug 778 : add description to campaign</span>
	<p>Added a description box on campaign maintenance screens.  It takes upto 200 characters.</p></li>

<li><span>bug 1019 : Prospect Campaign - need to indicate if campaign is completed</span>
	<p>We noticed that when viewing the prospect screen, the campaign information was minimal at best.
	We wanted to give the user a little more information, so now when on the prospect screen, the 
	associated campaign includes </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Name</li>
		<li>Description(*recently added)</li>
		<li>Completed Status(changes to Completed when all sales actions have been completed)</li>
		<li>Actions Remaining(actions left in to complete campaign)</li>
		<li>Total Actions(Total Actions in campaign)</li>
	</ul>
	</li>

<li><span>bug 1107 : auto fill date with todays date everywhere date is entered</span>
	<p>Wanted to add default date to entry screens.  Defaulted to the current date</p></li>

<li><span>Bug 1011 : Sales actions - instead of deleting, add active/inactive flag</span>
	<p>We now do not delete sales actions from database, instead we change a status to deleted.
	This will help keep track of salesman/saleswoman activity. Included is changed date and
	who changed the sales action.</p></li>


<li><span>Bug 1031 : Move min and max connections into Appconfig</span></li>


<li><span>Bug 1040 : campaign not working right on import</span>
	<p>We found an issue in the past when trying to assign a campaign to a list of prospects
	we were trying to import.  This is now resolved.  Simply enter the campaign id you would like
	to assign to the corresponding prospect and it will attach all campaign sales actions and default
	the sales action date to the import date, priority set to 1.</p></li>

<li><span>Bug 966 : add creation date to sales action</span>
	<p>We now keep track of when a prospect sales action is created, changed and deleted.</p></li>


</ul>
