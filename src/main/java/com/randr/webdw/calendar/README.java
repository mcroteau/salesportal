/**
 * Randr has included all database scripts.  They are packaged by version. You can simply upgrade
 * your current database by running the corresponding db_corrections_xyzversion scripts.  
 * 
 * The initial database scripts are also updated to work with the Sales Portal 1.1.3 release.  If you are 
 * starting from scratch, you do not need to run any of the correction scripts.  The only requirement
 * is that you run scripts 1-4 in the initial database scripts folder.  See below for details.
 * 
 * On a new database run:
 * 
 * 1_table_script.sql
 * 2_alter_script.sql
 * 3_index_script.sql
 * 4_initial_data_script.sql
 * 
 * 
 * For Sales Portal Support and Services please contact Mike at mike@mail.randrinc.com.  We want feedback,
 * we encourage users to write concerning Sales Portal, give us your thoughts and ideas on future releases.
 * Additional copies of documentation can be downloaded at www.randrinc.com - click on Sales Portal Penguin
 * 
 * Thanks, and enjoy.
